## :heavy_plus_sign: Description

This project is my portfolio created in 2014 based on Scotch-box. Since then all php code has been removed.
Unfortunately I didn't have much time to keep it up to date.
Currently, you can find me working on NextJs and React (no jquery :smile:).

Please check my other pinned projects for more up to date code samples.
